Bus Routes:
Test Bus Route Retrieval:

Test that the application can retrieve a list of available bus routes.
Test that the retrieved list is not empty.
Test Bus Route Search:

Test that searching for a specific bus route returns the correct result.
Test that searching for a non-existent bus route returns no results.
Ticket Booking:
Test Ticket Reservation:

Test that a user can reserve a ticket for a specific bus route.
Test that the reservation fails if the selected seats are not available.
Test Ticket Cancellation:

Test that a user can cancel their ticket reservation.
Test that cancellation fails if the ticket does not exist or if it's already canceled.
Payment Processing:
Test Payment Authorization:

Test that the application can authorize payments using different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
Test that authorization fails with invalid payment information.
Test Payment Confirmation:

Test that a successful payment confirms the ticket reservation.
Test that reservation is not confirmed if payment fails.
Application Functionality Testing:
User Experience:
Test User Interface:

Manually navigate through the application to ensure the user interface is intuitive and responsive.
Verify that all buttons, links, and forms work as expected.
Test Error Handling:

Submit forms with incorrect or incomplete data and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.
Bus Route Management:
Test Adding New Routes:

Add a new bus route and verify that it appears correctly in the list of available routes.
Test Updating Existing Routes:

Update the details of an existing route (e.g., departure time, price) and ensure the changes are reflected correctly.
Ticket Booking Flow:
Test Booking Process:

Book tickets for different routes and verify that the reservation process completes successfully.
Test Ticket Availability:

Simulate multiple users trying to book tickets for the same route simultaneously and ensure that the available seat count is updated correctly.
Payment Integration:
Test Payment Process:

Make test payments using various payment methods and verify that transactions are processed correctly.
Test Refund Process:

Cancel booked tickets and verify that refunds are processed correctly and reflected in the user's account balance.
Conclusion:
Unit tests ensure that each component of the application functions correctly in isolation, while functional testing verifies that the application works as a whole. By combining both types of testing, you can ensure the reliability and quality of your online bus ticket application. Additionally, consider automating unit tests where possible to streamline the testing process and catch regressions early.
